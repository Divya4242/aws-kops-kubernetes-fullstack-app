# This is the prometheus service file that uses a NodePort type of service. A NodePort service reserves a port on the node machine,
# allowing us to access the service using the node's IP address and the reserved port. Ex: http://<node-public-ip>:port 
# to access prometheus from my brwoser, I chose the NodePort type of service.
