# This is the frontend service file that uses a NodePort type of service. A NodePort service reserves a port on the node machine, 
# allowing us to access the service using the node's IP address and the reserved port. ex: http://<node-public-ip>:port 
# For simplicity, I chose the NodePort type of service. However, if you prefer to use a ClusterIP type of service, 
# it will work just as it is currently working.
