# This is the network policy for MongoDB to secure the MongoDB pod. I created an ingress policy that only allows incoming traffic from 
# the backend pod to the MongoDB pod. This means that only the backend pod can communicate with the MongoDB pod, 
# preventing any other pods from establishing a connection.
